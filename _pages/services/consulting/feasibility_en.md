As a consultant, I make measurements and report the results back to you.  
One of the things we can "measure" up front is the feasibility (i.e. can it be done?) of a project.
I put the quotes there because the measurements will not be exact. In reality it is a kind of fuzzy, iterative process, that nevertheless has to start somewhere.

### What I can do for you
I go in search of answers to questions like:
- Can it be done at all in reasonable time?
- How long will it take?
- How many developers are needed?
- What developer roles are needed?
- What technologies are best suited?

I can also write all this up nice and neat so you can hand it to potential investors.
