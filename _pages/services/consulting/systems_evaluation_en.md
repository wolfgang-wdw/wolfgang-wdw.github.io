Here I look at your system and its components from a bird's-eye view and look for improvement potential. I report back with any recommendations I have derived.

### What I can do for you
I evaluate your system based on a few standard criteria, like:
- Does it scale (if it needs to scale)?
- What are the operational costs?
- Is everything that can be automated, automated?
- What is the overall code quality?
- How is regression prevented?
- How scared are you to make changes?
- If you created a monster, can it be tamed or should it be replaced?
