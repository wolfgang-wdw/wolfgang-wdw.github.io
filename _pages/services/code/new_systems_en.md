What is a "backend system", anyway? Broadly speaking, it is everything that lies behind the curtain of your web site, mobile game, not mobile game, or anything else that interacts with a user and is connected to the internet.
The backend is usually broken up into a couple of more or less orthogonal services. For example:
- Change user data, like passwords, names, what have you
- Change the state of the game the user is playing
- A service where users can chat with each other in real time
- A service that handles payments
- A service that does some longer running calculations and stores results in the databases
- Or, hey, if you like to break it all up into that new thing the kids are doing, called Microservices, I'm game.

All this is usually backed by a database, or more databases. There might be caching involved. There is application logic. So much stuff!

While these things are not done overnight, I can do most of them in sequence, on my own or in concert with your peeps.

**Here are some of the things I can do for and with you**:

Programming languages and environments:
- Erlang and the OTP
- PHP and the LAMP stack
- Java and Apache Tomcat
- NodsJS and its many friends

Databases:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- RDS (AWS Relational Database Service)

Tooling/Deployment:
- Ansible
- AWS command line API scripting
- Shell, Python, Ruby, Perl, NodeJS, whatever gets the job done

Let's talk about what you want to have happen. Then we can decide on what technologies are suitable.
