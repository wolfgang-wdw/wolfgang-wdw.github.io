Broadly speaking, in the context online services, the backend is everything that lies behind the curtain of your web site, mobile game, not mobile game, or anything else that interacts with a user and is connected to the internet.
Building a full scale (and scalable) backend is quite the commitment and you will want a fully integrated, full-time developer for that.

Failing that, there are a few ways we can work together on a more granular basis. I can:
- Prototype some options to help you make decisions
- Create a minimally viable system to get you started
- Make some technical design suggestions "on paper"
- Create a module inside your already modularized system
- Modularize your system
- Build the whole system - Depending on your desired scope and my time constraints

Here are some technologies I work with:
- Java, JavaScript, Erlang, Ruby, Python, Shell
- Apache Tomcat, NodeJS, Erlang OTP
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Mnesia
- Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, AWS CLI)
- Old fashioned Linux servers
- Ansible, Puppet
- Jenkins (as a user and as an admin)
- Git, Github, Perforce (as a user and as an admin)

Anything else you fancy, let me know and I will go and bone up on it.
