Broadly speaking, in the context of online services, the backend is everything that lies behind the curtain of your web site, mobile game, not mobile game, or anything else that interacts with a user and is connected to the internet.  
It usually consists of a couple of application servers and databases, and a host of other auxiliary systems for monitoring, analysis, security, and so on.  
Building a full scale (and scalable) backend is quite the commitment and you will ideally have a fully integrated, full-time developer for that. Which can't be me, btw.

### What I can do for you
Even though I can't be with you full-time, there are a a couple of ways we can work together in manageable time frames. I can:
- Prototype some options to help you make decisions
- Create a minimally viable system to get you started
- Make some technical design suggestions "on paper"
- Create a module inside your already modularized system
- Modularize your system
- Interview potential full-time developers

Here are some technologies I can use:
- Java, JavaScript, Erlang, Ruby, Python, Shell
- Apache Tomcat, NodeJS, Erlang OTP
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Mnesia
- Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, AWS CLI)
- Old fashioned Linux servers
- Ansible, Puppet
- Jenkins (as a user and as an admin)
- Git, Github, Perforce (as a user and as an admin)

Something you need not on the list? Let me know and I will go and bone up on it.
