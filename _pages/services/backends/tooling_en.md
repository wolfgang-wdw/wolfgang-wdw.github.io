### Custom tools of the trade
Good tools enable the best people to do their best work.

[COTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf) is almost always the best choice, and I will always consider it first.

But sometimes you need more than what comes out of the box.

### What can I do for you?
Sharp tools and machinery, customized to your needs, for example:
- A converter for some proprietary data format that just wont die
- A system for compiling and building an especially complicated system (probably containing things that just wont die)
- That really complicated question that you always wanted to ask your database(s)

These are usually command line tools, written in Shell Script, Python, Ruby, or whatever else is at hand.

I will even write you a GUI tool or two. It's not my main forte, but, did I mention I like to learn? Bring it on.
