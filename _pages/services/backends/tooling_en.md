### Custom tools of the trade
Sometimes you need more than what comes out of the box.

[COTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf) is almost always the best choice, especially if there are strong customization options.

For example, I will never again write deployment scripts by hand. I will use things like Ansible, or Puppet, Salt, Chef, and so on, and customize whatever needs customizing.

Sometimes, though, you need a set of sharp tools, say:

- Convert something to some proprietary data format that just wont die
- Convert something FROM some proprietary data format that .. you catch my drift
- Convert large chunks of data from an old format to a fancy new one, or new database vendor all together
- Build an especially complicated system (probably using things that just wont die)

These are usually command line tools, written in Shell Script, Python, Ruby, or whatever seems suitable.

I will even write you a GUI tool or two. It's not my main forte, but, did I mention I like to learn? Bring it on.

The bottom line is, tooling is what enables the work you really want to do. Let me support you in this endeavor.
