Good tools enable the best people to do their best work.  
[COTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf) is almost always the best choice. Especially if there are good customization options.

But sometimes you need a little more than what comes out of the box. Every interesting project has unique challenges and complexities that might require a bit of custom tooling.

### What I can do for you
Sharp tools and machinery, customized to your needs, for example:
- A converter for some proprietary data format that just wont die
- A system for compiling and building an especially complicated system (probably containing things that just wont die)
- That really complicated question that you always wanted to ask your database(s)
- A specific plugin for your favorite IDE, 3D Modeling Software, Text Editor, and so on

I will even write you a GUI tool or two. It's not my main forte, but, did I mention I like to learn?
