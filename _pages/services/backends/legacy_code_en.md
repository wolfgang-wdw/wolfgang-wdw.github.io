### What is Legacy Code?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code), Legacy Code is "is source code that relates to a no-longer supported or manufactured operating system or other computer technology."

Michael Feathers calls it simply "code without tests", which might be a bit narrow, but it usually fits the bill.

I prefer to call it "code that everyone is afraid to change but it just wont die".

### What can I do for you ?

I can not and will not maintain your Legacy code. Sorry.

What I can do is the following:
- Put it under test and start cleaning it up
- Prepare it for changes that you need or, god forbid, new features
- Transition it to a more modern technology, while keeping it running

I get it, you kind of have gotten used to the devil you know. But you don't have to. Let me get down into that sewer and start cleaning up.
