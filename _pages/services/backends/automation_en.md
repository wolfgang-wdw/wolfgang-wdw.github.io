### Let me automate this for you
Almost all of the processes in backend development, deployment and operation can be automated. Here are some examples:
- Deployment of a new version of your software
- Backing up your Databases
- Collecting and aggregating operational information from multiple servers
- Changing the database schema in a non-destructive manner
- Unit Tests, Integration Tests, End-To-End Tests, etc
- Detection of critical failures and notification of first responders
- Load testing

Here is what I have used in the past:
- Raw: Shell, Python Ruby
- Capistrano
- Ansible
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) Command Line Interface
- All of the above mixed and matched
- Puppet
- Apache JMeter
- Old school make and its many descendants

If you need anything not on this list, let me know. I like to learn.
