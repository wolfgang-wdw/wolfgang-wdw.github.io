### Auto, mate
Almost all of the processes in backend deployment and operation can be automated. Some in development as well.

Here are some examples:
- Deployment of a new version of your software
- Changing the database schema in a non-destructive manner
- Continuous integration (repeatedly check your code and system for fleas)
- Backups of databases, configurations, etc.
- Load testing

### What can I do for you?
I can automate these processes, using tools and technologies such as:
- Shell, Python, Ruby
- Capistrano
- Ansible
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) Command Line Interface
- All of the above mixed and matched
- Puppet
- Apache JMeter
- Old school make and its many descendants

If you need anything not on this list, let me know. I like to learn.
