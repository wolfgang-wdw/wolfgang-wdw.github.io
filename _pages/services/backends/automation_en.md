Almost all of the processes in backend deployment and operation can be automated.  
Here are some examples:
- Deployment of a new version of your software.
- Changing the database schema in a non-destructive manner.
- Continuous integration (repeatedly check your code and system for fleas).
- Backups of databases, configurations, etc.
- Simulate user traffic to your system (for [load testing](/services/devops/load_testing_en), say).

### What I can do for you
I can automate the aforementioned processes, using tools and technologies such as:
- Shell, Python, Ruby
- Capistrano
- Ansible
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) Command Line Interface
- Puppet
- Apache JMeter
- Old school make and its many descendants
- All of the above mixed and matched

If you need anything not on this list, let me know. I like to learn.
