### "Will this scale?"
This is a good question to ask, despite it being [made fun of](https://medium.com/conquering-corporate-america/10-tricks-to-appear-smart-during-meetings-27b489a39d1a).

Scaling is the act of scaling a running system up (or down), with as little downtime as possible and/or necessary.

Scalability of all systems involved should be considered as early as possible in development.

Some things are easy to scale, other things are hard to scale. It's easy, trivial even, to scale a fleet of load balanced, restful application servers. It's harder to scale state-full systems and databases.

Many scaling problems can be solved or made irrelevant by architectural decisions in conjunction with system requirements.

Scaling can be done automatically, in response to predefined rules, or by hand. This usually depends on what part of the systems you are scaling.

The ultimate goal is to make scaling just a matter of how much coin you insert into your hosting provider. Ask me how.
