### DevOps is ...?
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) has a fancy definition if you care for it.
DevOps is basically about how developers and operators (and maybe managers) of backend systems talk to each other in order to ensure the best outcome on the backend (pun intended).
Or you can just call it LiveOps without completely ignoring the developers. Who knew that would be a good idea.

So the developers have told you what they want to build, and you have told them how you will deploy it, it's time to operate it.
And so a big part of DevOps for me is the operation of a backend.

Deployment -> Dev, Stage, Live
Making sure to use the right "hardware"/cloud/hosting
Keep a look on the pricing
Keep it running
Detect problems
Randomly turn off stuff (-> Monitoring)
