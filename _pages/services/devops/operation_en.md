DevOps (short for a combination of "development" and "operation") is about how developers and operators (and maybe managers) of backend systems can communicate most effectively.

Or you can just call it LiveOps without completely ignoring the developers and stakeholders. Who knew that would be a good idea.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) has the fancy definition, if you care for it.

### What I can do for you
Operating backend systems is my main contribution to DevOps.  
This includes:
- Facilitating communication between the parties mentioned above
- Automating the provisioning ("spinning up") of computing resources
- Creating and automating the deployment pipeline
- Setting up reproducible local systems for developers
- Setting up automated end-to-end tests
