### What is DevOps?
DevOps is basically about how developers and operators (and maybe managers) of backend systems talk to each other in order to ensure the best outcome on the backend (pun intended).

Or you can just call it LiveOps without completely ignoring the developers and stakeholders. Who knew that would be a good idea.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) has the fancy definition, if you care for it.

### What can I do for you?
Operating backend systems is my major role in DevOps. I can do things like:
- Facilitate communication between the parties mentioned above
- Automate provisioning of computing resources
- Automate the deployment of your systems
- Set up reproducible local systems for developers
- Set up automated end-to-end tests
