If you run a backend system, you will need to monitor it. Things people are usually interested in are, among others:
- Performance (do I need to scale up/down?)
- System behavior (errors, warnings, all the witty messages dumped into log files)
- User behavior (for optimizing the experience and resulting cash flow)
- Ways to alert first responders in case of outages

### What I can do for you
Most of the above mentioned things can be added to an existing system, using out of the box or custom solutions, such as:
- AWS Cloudwatch
- New Relic
- Elastic (ELK) Stack
- Any cloud logging service with an API (Loggly, Papertrail, etc)
- Munin
- Nagios
