"Load Testing" (or Stress Testing) is the act of sending traffic into your system such that you can gauge the limits of its high and low level performance markers.  
This goes from your database architecture to how much write throughput your disks should have.

As with most other aspects of DevOps, load testing should be integrated as early as possible in development (but not earlier).

It will not only answer crucial early questions about the scalability of your architecture, but also uncover bugs that only occur in high concurrency situations.

### What I can do for you
- Build and run load tests for your existing systems
- Provide readable results and recommend remedies, if any
- Build disposable shadow systems for repeated load testing
- Use existing tools like JMeter and friends
- Roll custom tools for your special load testing needs
