According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_code), Legacy Code is "is source code that relates to a no-longer supported or manufactured operating system or other computer technology."

Michael Feathers calls it simply "code without tests", which might be a bit narrow, but it usually fits the bill.

I prefer to call it "code that everyone is afraid to change and that just wont die".

### What I can do for you
While I can't maintain your legacy code, I can do the following:
- Put it under test and start cleaning it up.
- Prepare it for changes that you need or, god forbid, new features.
- Transition it to a more modern technology, while keeping everything running.

I get it, you have kind of gotten used to the devil you know. But there is another way. I'm not afraid of getting my hands dirty in your plumbing.
