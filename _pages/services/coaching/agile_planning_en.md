The world "Agile" sounds so high minded. I am not a fan. It gives people the wrong ideas.  
But it also kind of fits. You want to be agile. You want to be able to change direction.  
And planning, obviously, is vital for any serious project.

Agile planning is simply planning while trying to not be too uptight about it.

It is also an exercise in communication between the stakeholders and the developers:  
The ones defining the results, and the ones creating the results.

Agile does not mean you can change things willy nilly on a whim.

It does mean to enable change. Which kind of change you want to enable or disable is evolving as the project matures.  
In the end, every line of code should be mappable back to something that has been planned, implemented and verified.

If that sounds too good to be true, of course it is. Day to day reality is messy.  

### What I can do for you
Still, we can carve out a little bit of order. Here are examples of how I can help:

- Sketch out ways to plan your project, given all it's unique and specific complexities.
- Help out in the initial planning stages.
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers.
- Recommend ways to make the planning process visible and repeatable.
- Help establish stable iterations and feedback loops
