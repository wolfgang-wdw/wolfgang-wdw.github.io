### DevOps is hard but ..
The challenges of DevOps are manifold, and maybe you are just starting out and you are running into specific problems.

Or maybe you have no idea where to even start. That's a specific problem, too.

Or you can't even even identify a specific problem things just .. don't feel right?

### What can I do for you?

- Deployment - what, how, when, where to
- Local server development "best practices"
- Minimizing downtime
- Rolling out a new feature
- Getting started from scratch with DevOps
