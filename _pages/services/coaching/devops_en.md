The challenges of DevOps are manifold, and maybe you are just starting out and you are running into specific problems.  
Or maybe you have no idea where to even start. That's a specific problem, too.  
Or you can't even identify a specific problem but things just .. don't feel right?

### What I can do for you
- Deployment pipeline
: What it is, how to automate it, development vs staging vs live systems, and so on.
- Local server development
: "But it does not work on my machine" kind of issues. Easing the pressure of keeping development machines in sync.
- Minimizing downtime
: We look at the various components and identify ways to do just that. We also look at the issue of scheduled downtime, and if you want to afford it.
- Rolling out a new feature
: The path from local server to development, staging, live. Integration of QA processes.
- Getting started from scratch with DevOps
: Recommendations depending on your requirements, or, say, a short and snappy presentation of what I learned "from the trenches".
