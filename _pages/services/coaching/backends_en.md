Coaching is the art of asking the right questions to tease out answers.  
I will gladly share with you what I know about backend development, in a hands on and interactive way.

### What I can do for you
- Got started but you got stuck?
: [Code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell_(Programmierung))? Not sure if you are using the "right" technology? Let me unstick you.
- Don't know how to get started?
: Lots and lots of ideas, but a sense of overwhelm? Let's untangle the web and start planning.
- Have a specific sticky issue?
: A server is doing random, weird things? CPU/Memory/Disk spikes with no good reason? Queries that take hours? Let Unstickman help you.
- Want to know a specific trick?
: I inform you that there are no tricks. And then we move on from there.

Anything else? Let's [talk](/contact_en).
