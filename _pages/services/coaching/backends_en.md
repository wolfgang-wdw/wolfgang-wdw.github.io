### Coaching, huh?
Coaching is the art of asking the right questions. A gentle nudging in a direction you already suspect to be right.

I will gladly share with you and your peeps what I know about backend development, either in one on one or one to many sessions.

### What can I do for you?
- Got started but you got stuck? I get you unstuck.
- Don't know how to get started? I get you started
- Have a specific sticky issue? I help you unstick it
- Want to know a specific trick? I tell you there are no tricks.

Anything else? Let's [talk](/contact_en).
