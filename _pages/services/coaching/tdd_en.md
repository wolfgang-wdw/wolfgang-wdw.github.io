I have successfully used [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) for a couple of years now.
Especially for backend systems, where no pesky GUI is involved, it can work very well.  
That said, I am more than willing to expand that notion.

### What I can do for you
Depending on where you are with TDD, I can help you out in various ways:
- Curious but don't know where to start?
: I can give a little crash course to a meeting-room sized audience.
- Kind of into it but want do dive deeper?
: I can pair up with your developers and get diving, or we do a little workshop.
- Have an area in your code where you are sure TDD does NOT work (but you would like it to)?
: We can take it on together and see what we can learn.
