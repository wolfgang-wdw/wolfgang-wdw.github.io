I have successfully used Test Driven Development for a couple of years now.
Especially for backend systems, where no pesky GUI is involved, it can work very well.

Depending on where you are with TDD, I can help you out in various ways:

- Curious but don't know where to start?
: I can give an example driven crash course to a meeting-room sized audience.
- Kind of into it but want do dive deeper?
: I can pair up with your developers and get diving.
- Have an area in your code where you are sure it does NOT work (but you would like it to)?
: We can take it on together and see what we can learn.
